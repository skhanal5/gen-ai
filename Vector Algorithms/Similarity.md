## About
- Measure of how closely related two vectors are
- Recall: vectors are numerical representations that capture semantic meaning
- Distance of two vectors should resemble semantic similarity
- Popular measures:
    - Cosine similarity
## Cosine Similarity
- Recap:
    - Ranges between [-1,1]
    - Cosine of the angle between two vectors
    - Computation:
        - dot product of vectors divided by product of their lengths
