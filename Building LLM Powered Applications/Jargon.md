### Deep Learning
* Branch of ML
* Characterized by NN's with many layers
* Learn from hierarchical data representation
	* Each layer extracts features from the input
	* Model intricate relationships and patterns
### Language Foundation Models (LFM's)
* Pre-trained generative AI model that is adaptable
* Trained on diverse datasets
	* Not limited to text: can do audio, images, and videos
* Designed with transfer learning in mind:
	* can apply knowledge to other similar tasks they haven't seen before
* Properties:
	* Billions of parameters
	* Large architectures
	* Strong generalization skills
#### Large Language Model
* A subset of LFM's
* When an LFM's input is unstructured, natural language data, it is considered an LLM
* Specifically designed for NLP tasks
### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* A branch of AI that deals with human language
* Gen AI and NLU algorithms are both related to NLP
#### Generative AI
* Purpose: create new natural language content
* Practical usage:
	* Text summarization
	* Text generation
	* Image captioning
	* Style transfer
#### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
* Purpose: Understanding existing natural language content
* Practical usage:
	* Chatbots
	* Q&A
	* Sentiment Analysis
	* Machine translation
