### Extending Non-parametric Knowledge
* Allow model to get access to other sources of information which will be integrated with its existing knowledge
### Few-shot learning
* LLM is given a metaprompt and some examples of tasks it will perform
	* Metaprompt is a instructino to improve performance of tasks w/ examples
* Uses prior knowledge + examples to perform task
### Fine Tuning
* Using smaller task-specific datasets to customize the foundational models
* Parameters of pre-trained model are optimized towards the specific task
