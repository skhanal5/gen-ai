### About
* Transformer based architecture
* Emphasis on safety
	* Has a concept of *constitutional AI* (CAI) to aid this
* Has a context length of 100,000 tokens
	* Meaning you can provide as input large documents
* Really good at coding problems
### CAI
* Idea is that Claude will honor the following:
	* will not aid in illegal activities
	* prevent toxic output
	* etc.
* Uses a set of principles that guides the model's behavior and outputs
	* Not totally dependent on human feedback/data
* Principles come from:
	* UN's Declaration of Human Rights
	* Research
	* Trust and safety practices
	* etc.
* Principles are used in training:
	* Model is trained to critique and revise its own responses
	* Model is trained with reinforcement learning
		* Uses AI generated feedback based on its principles to pick the most "harmless" output
